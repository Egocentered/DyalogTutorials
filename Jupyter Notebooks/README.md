# DyalogTutorials Jupyter Notebooks
These notebooks include explanations and code to help you learn Dyalog / APL.  

__More Dyalog Jupyter Notebooks are available [here](https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-notebooks)__

Click on a notebook to view it - GitHub renders notebooks fairly well.  
However, sometimes multi-line APL output renders incorrectly.  
It is recommended that you either:  
- Paste the notebook URL into [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).  
- Paste the notebook URL into the bar at the bottom of the __Learn__ tab in [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org/) (this way you can interact with the code without installing Dyalog, but some features are restricted).  
- Install [Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) and the [Dyalog Jupyter Kernel](https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-kernel/wiki/1.-Offline-usage) to get a full unrestriced interactive experience.
